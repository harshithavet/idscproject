# Official Description:

In an effort to stave off the environmental crisis that is predicted to occur later this century, many 
cities have begun to implement policies with the objective of reducing the ecological impact that urban places have on the environment due to their advanced industrialization. Thus, our goal is to analyze the energy program of one such city, Chicago, Illinois, to measure the success of their efforts as a whole, and locate any other trends regarding energy use in the city.

The technical tools used to complete this analysis are:
Python — Programming Language
Colab — Web IDE, for ease of collaboration

Packages used to complete analysis are:
Pandas — Data Analysis
Numpy — Number manipulation
Matplotlib.pyplot — Data Visualization
Seaborn — Data Visualization
Sklearn — Predictive Analytics

# Methodology
Chicago_Energy.ipynb - A Jupyter Notebook file that contains the descriptive and predictive analytics used to answer the following research questions:
  Is there a linear association between Total GHG emissions and the following factors: electricity use & square feet?
  Is there a significant difference between the mean ghg usage between different types of buildings?


# Dataset: Chicago Energy Benchmarking 2020 

Chicago Energy Benchmarking (CSV) sourced through: City of Chicago Data Portal
